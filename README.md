This project was taken from Eric Capuano's "So You want to be a SOC Analyst" blog. 

It starts by creating and attacker and victim VM. Creating a C2 server on the attack host and connecting to the victim. From there we I viewed the events through the Lima Charlie EDR tool on the victim client. 

I was able to create some D&R and YARA rules to defend and alert against the C2 server

This project is being done via home lab so I took notes via email since I don't have any other good note taking tools available. Please download to view the results.
